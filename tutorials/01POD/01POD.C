/// \brief The perform_POD application is used to perform POD on a standard OpenFOAM case.
/// In this tutorial the POD is applied on a simple lid-driven cavity example. The case is solved 
/// using icoFoam and then the modes are extracted using the perform_POD utility. The modes,
/// together with the eigenvalues and the cumulative eigenvalues are stored inside the ITHACAoutput/POD
/// folder.
/// In order to run it launch and explore the Allrun file. For more details see also the perform_POD.C file.
